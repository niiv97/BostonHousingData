Objective: This project's objective is to assist individuals who are interested in buying or renting a home in Boston and those who want to make investment decisions in the housing market. To achieve this objective, we analyze the market dynamics in different towns and identify critical factors such as the number of rooms per dwelling, age of buildings, median home value, crime rate in the neighborhood, and accessibility to radial highways.
